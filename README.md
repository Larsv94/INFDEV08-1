# INFDEV08-1
This project was for the subject Development 08 at Hogeschool Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We were supposed to build a couple of programs with Processing using real world data.

## Task 1
The first task was to create a program that draws coordinates at the right points on an image given a real world scale image and real world coordinates. In this case we had to use a map of iceland and a list of its cities.

## Task 2
Secondly, we got a large list with data sets and had to find which data sets had a correlation. This was done by plotting each data set against the others and creating a visual representation.

## Task 3
The last task was to take a data set with real world height data from the city Rotterdam and create a visual representation. Next we had to create the ability for the user to flood the city.

### Additions
With this task I decided to go full out and make it work with any data set regardless of the location. I also made it fully animated and allowed the user to play, pause and stop the simulation at wish.
I also added the ability to decide the flooding rate. And finally I allowed the user to safe an image of the simulation at any point.

## Troubleshooting
If this project does not work, you have to reset the locations of the processing and Gson library.
